## 📝 Overview

The initial concept for Suicastle is to leverage zklogin, with sponsorship from Enoki, and build on the Sui network. Our goal is to address the challenges of Web3 game adoption. The game is hosted on Telegram, making it as user-friendly as a typical Web2 game. This approach encourages more people to try out the game without needing complicated setups.

The in-game assets are diverse, allowing users to own various items, such as knights, heroes with special abilities, and unique characters. These items make the game more engaging and offer players different strategies to explore. Players can develop a strong attachment to their game characters. All digital assets are securely recorded using blockchain technology, ensuring true ownership and providing opportunities for players to trade or upgrade their items in the future.
